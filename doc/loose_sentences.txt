The majority of available tools are difficult to install. Many tools
(such as the Ensembl pipeline \citep{Potter2004}) have grown
organically over the years and were never developed to be deployed at
third party sites. Tools such as Taverna \citep{Oinn2004} are easy to
install, provided that one wants to rely on analysis services provided
over the internet. 

Capacity is an obvious requirement, particularly given the advent of
next generation sequencing techniques. Obviously the available
hardware infrastructure is a principal factor provided that the
software running the analysis is capable of handling the process. The
ability

With increasing sequencing throughput, the capacity to analyse the
data becomes more and more important. This capacity depends on a
combination of the software and
