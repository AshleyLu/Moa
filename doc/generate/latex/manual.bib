	search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize
	a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score.
	Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores
	allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the
	statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
	is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and
	applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and
	protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
	searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in
	long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability
	to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than
	existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  title = {In silico miRNA prediction in metazoan genomes: balancing between
	sensitivity and specificity.},
  journal = {BMC Genomics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10},
  pages = {204},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short approximately 21-nucleotide
	RNA molecules, play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation
	of gene expression. The number of known miRNA hairpins registered
	in the miRBase database is rapidly increasing, but recent reports
	suggest that many miRNAs with restricted temporal or tissue-specific
	expression remain undiscovered. Various strategies for in silico
	miRNA identification have been proposed to facilitate miRNA discovery.
	Notably support vector machine (SVM) methods have recently gained
	popularity. However, a drawback of these methods is that they do
	not provide insight into the biological properties of miRNA sequences.
	RESULTS: We here propose a new strategy for miRNA hairpin prediction
	in which the likelihood that a genomic hairpin is a true miRNA hairpin
	is evaluated based on statistical distributions of observed biological
	variation of properties (descriptors) of known miRNA hairpins. These
	distributions are transformed into a single and continuous outcome
	classifier called the L score. Using a dataset of known miRNA hairpins
	from the miRBase database and an exhaustive set of genomic hairpins
	identified in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans, a subset of 18
	most informative descriptors was selected after detailed analysis
	of correlation among and discriminative power of individual descriptors.
	We show that the majority of previously identified miRNA hairpins
	have high L scores, that the method outperforms miRNA prediction
	by threshold filtering and that it is more transparent than SVM classifiers.
	CONCLUSION: The L score is applicable as a prediction classifier
	with high sensitivity for novel miRNA hairpins. The L-score approach
	can be used to rank and select interesting miRNA hairpin candidates
	for downstream experimental analysis when coupled to a genome-wide
	set of in silico-identified hairpins or to facilitate the analysis
	of large sets of putative miRNA hairpin loci obtained in deep-sequencing
	efforts of small RNAs. Moreover, the in-depth analyses of miRNA hairpins
	descriptors preceding and determining the L score outcome could be
	used as an extension to miRBase entries to help increase the reliability
	and biological relevance of the miRNA registry.},

  abstract = {Research in the past decade revealed that peptide ligands, also called

	a family of plant-specific genes, CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING
	REGION (ESR) (CLE), which has at least 31 members in Arabidopsis
	genome, are able to generate extracellular peptides to regulate cell
	division and differentiation. A hydroxyl 12-amino acid peptide derived
	from the conserved CLE motif of CLV3 promotes cell differentiation,
	whereas another CLE-derived peptide suppresses the differentiation.
	These peptides probably interact with membrane-bound, leucine-rich
	repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) to execute the decision between

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {96},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern omics research involves the application of high-throughput
	technologies that generate vast volumes of data. These data need
	to be pre-processed, analyzed and integrated with existing knowledge
	through the use of diverse sets of software tools, models and databases.
	The analyses are often interdependent and chained together to form
	complex workflows or pipelines. Given the volume of the data used
	and the multitude of computational resources available, specialized
	pipeline software is required to make high-throughput analysis of
	large-scale omics datasets feasible. RESULTS: We have developed a
	generic pipeline system called Cyrille2. The system is modular in
	design and consists of three functionally distinct parts: 1) a web
	based, graphical user interface (GUI) that enables a pipeline operator
	to manage the system; 2) the Scheduler, which forms the functional
	core of the system and which tracks what data enters the system and
	determines what jobs must be scheduled for execution, and; 3) the
	Executor, which searches for scheduled jobs and executes these on
	a compute cluster. CONCLUSION: The Cyrille2 system is an extensible,
	modular system, implementing the stated requirements. Cyrille2 enables
	easy creation and execution of high throughput, flexible bioinformatics
	pipelines.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: We introduce GMAP, a standalone program for mapping and
	aligning cDNA sequences to a genome. The program maps and aligns
	a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements,
	and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program
	generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial
	polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice
	site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal
	sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate
	alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification
	with statistical significance testing. RESULTS: On a set of human
	messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3\% rate, GMAP identified
	all splice sites accurately in over 99.3\% of the sequences, which
	was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set
	of human expressed sequence tags, GMAP provided higher-quality alignments
	more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, GMAP performed
	comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, GMAP demonstrated
	a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs. AVAILABILITY:
