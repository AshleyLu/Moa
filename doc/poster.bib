  abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment
	search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize
	a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score.
	Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores
	allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the
	statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
	is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and
	applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and
	protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
	searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in
	long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability
	to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than
	existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: In silico experiments in bioinformatics involve the co-ordinated
	use of computational tools and information repositories. A growing
	number of these resources are being made available with programmatic
	access in the form of Web services. Bioinformatics scientists will
	need to orchestrate these Web services in workflows as part of their
	analyses. RESULTS: The Taverna project has developed a tool for the
	composition and enactment of bioinformatics workflows for the life
	sciences community. The tool includes a workbench application which
	provides a graphical user interface for the composition of workflows.
	These workflows are written in a new language called the simple conceptual
	unified flow language (Scufl), where by each step within a workflow
	represents one atomic task. Two examples are used to illustrate the
	ease by which in silico experiments can be represented as Scufl workflows
	using the workbench application.},

  abstract = {The Ensembl pipeline is an extension to the Ensembl system which allows
	automated annotation of genomic sequence. The software comprises
	two parts. First, there is a set of Perl modules ("Runnables" and
	"RunnableDBs") which are 'wrappers' for a variety of commonly used
	analysis tools. These retrieve sequence data from a relational database,
	run the analysis, and write the results back to the database. They
	inherit from a common interface, which simplifies the writing of
	new wrapper modules. On top of this sits a job submission system
	(the "RuleManager") which allows efficient and reliable submission
	of large numbers of jobs to a compute farm. Here we describe the
	fundamental software components of the pipeline, and we also highlight
	some features of the Sanger installation which were necessary to
	enable the pipeline to scale to whole-genome analysis.},
