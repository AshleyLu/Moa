  abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment
	search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize
	a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score.
	Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores
	allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the
	statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
	is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and
	applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and
	protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
	searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in
	long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability
	to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than
	existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

  title = {GMAP: a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: We introduce GMAP, a standalone program for mapping and
	aligning cDNA sequences to a genome. The program maps and aligns
	a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements,
	and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program
	generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial
	polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice
	site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal
	sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate
	alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification
	with statistical significance testing. RESULTS: On a set of human
	messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3\% rate, GMAP identified
	all splice sites accurately in over 99.3\% of the sequences, which
	was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set
	of human expressed sequence tags, GMAP provided higher-quality alignments
	more often than blat did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, GMAP performed
	comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, GMAP demonstrated
	a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs. AVAILABILITY:
	Source code for gmap and associated programs is available at http://www.gene.com/share/gmap
