  abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment
	search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize
	a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score.
	Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores
	allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the
	statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm
	is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and
	applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and
	protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification
	searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in
	long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability
	to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than
	existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},
