This chapter contains, as a reference, all help documentation of all
templates currently in the Moa repository. It is possible to get the
(latest) version of the help for each template by running:

    make help

in a directory with a Moa analysis. Moreover, if an Makefile links to
multiple templates, on the fly generated help will detail all targets
that can be used and all parameters that can be defined.
