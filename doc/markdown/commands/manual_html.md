    moa manual_html
    
Will generate a subdirectory in the current directory called
`moa_manual` containing an HTML version of the Moa
Manual. Alternatively you can run:

    moa manual_html /path/to/output/directory
    
to generate the manual in an alternative location.

After manual generation you can point your webbrowser to the following
path:

    file:///full/path/to/output/directory/index.html
    

Note that the generated manual is specific for your Moa installation;
only reference pages for all installed templates and plugins will be
generated.
