------------------------------------------------

**Newbler** - Run a simple, out of the box, newbler assembly. As an extra feature, this template automatically creates uniquely named links to the two main output fasta files (454AllContigs.fna, 454LargeContigs.fna). This is convenient for subsequence gather steps. The links are named after the directory.
