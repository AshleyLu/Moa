*Lightweight, command line, workflows for bioinformatics*

Moa aims to assist a bioinformatician to organize, document, share,
execute and repeat workflows in a command line environment without
losing flexibility, and, at all times giving the user full access to
all aspects of the workflow (see also :ref:`goals`).


**NOTE: both the software and the manual are under development. Things might change.**
