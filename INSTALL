Prerequisites

- GNU Make

Furthermore; Moa probably uses bash specific commands. I haven't
tested other shells.


Installation

- Get the latest version from github (which you probably already have,
  since you're reading this file). If not, get a recent version from:

    http://github.com/mfiers/Moa/downloads

  Or, alternatively, get the latest version from git. This is probably
  the best choice:

	git clone git://github.com/mfiers/Moa.git

- Either move or unpack the downloaded software to a suitable location
  (for example /opt/moa or ~/moa)

- Set the following environment variables:

  * MOABASE=/opt/moa
  * PATH=$PATH:/opt/moa/bin

- Set permissions, assuming all users on this machine are allowed
  to use Moa.

  * chmod -R a+rX /opt/moa
  * chmod a+rx /opt/moa/bin/*
