Welcome to Moa!

*Lightweight, command line, workflows for bioinformatics*

Moa aims to assist a bioinformatician to organize, document, share,
execute and repeat workflows in a command line environment without
losing any of the flexibility of the command line, and, at all times
giving the user full access to all aspects of the workflow (see also
:ref:`goals`).


**NOTE: both the software and the manual are under development. Things
  might change.**
