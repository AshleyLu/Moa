Goals
=====

Moa has as objective to assist in keeping a bioinformatics project:

- *Organized*: 

    Moa facilitates project organization in many (smaller and more
    major) ways, for example by providing a uniform way to capture
    commands as Moa jobs. Each Moa job is linked to a specific
    directory, and has all configuration, templates, data, and
    intermediate data available as files in this directory structure.

- *Documented*: 

    Moa provides the possibility to add a title, description and
    changelogs to each job.

- *Reproducible*

   By having all templates and configuration copied into a workflow -
   the workflow does never change (unless the user wants it to), even
   if templates in the repository change. Moreover, all templates are
   easy to find & inspect so it is always clear what happened.

- *Reusable & Shareable*: 

   Moa provides reusable templates. New templates are easy to create,
   adapt and share. Workflows can be archived and reused with
   different data.

- *Flexible*:

    Moa provides a good number of hooks to insert custom code into a
    workflow, making that code part of the workflow. This ensures
    maximum flexibility.
