Goals
=====

Moa aims to assist in achieving the following for a bioinformatics
project:

- *Organized*: 

    Moa facilitates project organization by allowing at only one
    `job` per directory, and, by having all configuration, templates,
    data, and intermediate data available as files in this directory
    structure.     

- *Documented*: 

    Moa provides the possibility to add a title, description and
    changelogs to each job.

- *Reproducible*

   By having all templates and configuration copied into a workflow -
   the workflow does never change (unless the user wants it to), even
   if templates in the repository change. Moreover, all templates are
   easy to find & inspect so it is always clear what happened.

- *Reusable & Shareable*: 

   Moa provides reusable templates. New templates are easy to create,
   adapt and share. Workflows can be archived and reused with
   different data.

- *Flexible*:

    Moa provides a good number of hooks to insert custom code into a
    workflow, making that code part of the workflow. This ensures
    maximum flexibility.
